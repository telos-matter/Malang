# Malang &nbsp; ![DEVELOPMENT STATUS: version 3 pre-release](https://badgen.net/badge/DEVELOPMENT%20STATUS/version%203%20pre-release/green)
**Ma**th **lang**uage

Programming using, literally, only algebraic operations.

That is, any program that you write in the language, becomes a mathematical operation that, when computed / evaluated, gives the expected result of the program.

You can read the [wiki](https://github.com/telos-matter/Malang/wiki) to understand the **what** and the **how**. But in here I will discuss the

# Why?

TODO, lol

***

# Requirements
Nothing, just `python 3.10` or newer.

# How-to
After cloning the repo, you can run files using [malang.py](malang.py) like so:
```console
$ python malang.py file_to_run
```

Don't forget the check out the couple of options available when running a file by using:
```console
$ python malang.py -h
```

# Examples
Some examples are available in the [examples dir](examples). A favorite is the [FizzBuzz](examples/fizzBuzz.mlg) example, as that it uses all the interessting aspects of the language.

You can run it like so:
```console
$ python malang.py -i examples/fizzBuzz 15
```

# Syntax support
I made a VSCode extension that provides syntax highlighting / support for the language, but I haven't published it. Will maybe do so later on, or if someone is interested.
