Booleans here are as such:
            True is 1 and False is 0

        If False is 0 and True is different than 0 then 
        parse your values trough parseBoolean, which does the same as diffZero


Keep in mind (that in order to keep in mathematically right) when using the _if statement that you can't just put what ever in else, like div by zero
