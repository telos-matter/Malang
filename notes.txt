- "Booleans" here are as such:
            True is 1 and False is 0


- Keep in mind (that in order to keep stuff mathematically correct) when using the _if statement you can't just put whatever in the else part, like div by zero



TODOS:
- Don't forget syntax in vscode extensions
- About syntax, function name can't betrayed as consts
- TODO add todo highlight and fixme highlight
- '''Right now there is only the possibility to compile
    and run a source file
    I want later on to add possibility to compile alone
    and then to run a compiled source file'''
- # TODO add possibility to store compiled version as math equation



- Im actually not sure how does the optimization thing work. Does it really even work? Since the instructions always refer to the same object, then there is no need for it because it always gets optimized. However max_stack_depth do gets reached when I don't use the opt function
