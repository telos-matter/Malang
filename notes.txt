- "Booleans" here are as such:
            True is 1 and False is 0

- Keep in mind (that in order to keep stuff mathematically correct) when using the if statements you can't just put whatever in the else part, like div by zero. It still is a function after all, both arguments get evaluated
- NN in methods refer to non-negative, meaning it only works properly with positive numbers or null
