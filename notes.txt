- "Booleans" here are as such:
            True is 1 and False is 0


- Keep in mind (that in order to keep stuff mathematically correct) when using the _if statement you can't just put whatever in the else part, like div by zero



TODOS:

- '''Right now there is only the possibility to compile
    and run a source file
    I want later on to add possibility to compile alone
    and then to run a compiled source file'''
- # TODO add possibility to store compiled version as math equation


- NN in methods refer to non-negative, meaning it only works properly with positive numbers or null
