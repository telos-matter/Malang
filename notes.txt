TODOS:
- Don't forget syntax in vscode extensions
- About syntax, function name can't betrayed as consts
- TODO add todo highlight and fixme highlight

    and run a source file
    I want later on to add possibility to compile alone
    and then to run a compiled source file'''
- # TODO add possibility to store compiled version as math equation
- loops
