Precedence order is PEMDAS (), ^, */ //, +-

Parenthesis can span lines
Var assign ends with new line unless parenthensis
Parens can span multiple lines, but ops are in same line
; terminates expressions

Vars are case sensitive


def func (
These need be like this, ) {} can span lines 


A function is only defined when it hits the } 

You can define functions inside functions with same name? Yes

File includes are literally just includes, it is as if you took that file and pasted it there


Anonymous functions are block of code that are executed and have their own scope with their own res, is a value element and an instruction node



Once if implemented I think that both, pretty sure *,  both if and the else will be executed, and thus the state of the vars is always updated, its the return value that changes



In the same scope two functions can't have the same name. A scope is entered on each new function or anon_function


Also I wanna add a ret keyword that either returns what's in front of it or res if nothing in front


Negative number exists as they re so -5^2 == 25 but - 5^2 is -25
