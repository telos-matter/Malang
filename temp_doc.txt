Precedence order is PEMDAS (), ^, */ //, +-

Parenthesis can span lines
Var assign ends with new line unless parenthensis
Parens can span multiple lines, but ops are in same line

Vars are case sensitive


def func (
These need be like this, ) {} can span lines 

For the time being you can only reference vars inside your scope
Planning on adding an ext keyword and referencing outside variables, maybe

A function is only defined when it hits the }
Ofc no recursion and can only call functions above you

You can define functions inside functions with same name? idk
