Precedence order is PEMDAS (), ^, */ //, +-

Parenthesis can span lines
Var assign ends with new line unless parenthensis
Parens can span multiple lines, but ops are in same line
; terminates expressions

Vars are case sensitive


def func (
These need be like this, ) {} can span lines 

For the time being you can only assign to vars inside your scope
Planning on adding an ext keyword to assign to and reference outside variables, maybe
Ext  only allows u to set external values in var assign, nothing else, you can still reference
Outside functions and variables, as long as they are not overshadowed by a local variable

A function is only defined when it hits the }
Ofc no recursion and can only call functions above you

You can define functions inside functions with same name? Yes

File includes are literally just includes, it is as if you took that file and pasted it there


Anonymous functions are block of code that are executed and have their own scope with their own res, is a value element and an instruction node


Once if implemented I think that both, pretty sure *,  both if and the else will be executed, and thus the state of the vars is always updated, its the return value that changes
